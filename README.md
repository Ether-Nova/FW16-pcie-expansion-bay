# FW16-pcie-expansion-bay
My goal for this project is to be able to connect any common pcie device to the framework 16. The expansion bay would include 75W power to the gen 4 x8 (4 x16 phisical size) slot and allow pcie extenders and aother devices to be connected to it. 
I am currently in the phase of tesing a covnertor for the 12V 75W bus.
Please note i am still in highschool so i am bound to make many mistakes
